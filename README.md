# ðŸ’Ž Diamond as Gnosis Safe Guard (Diamond Guard / Guard Facet)

**Gnosis Safe Guard** built on top of the **Diamond Standard (EIP-2535)**.

---

## Abstract

**Diamond Guard** is a **Safe Smart Account Guard** implemented as a **Facet** within the **Diamond Standard architecture**.  

Its goal is to create a Guard that is not only secure but also **upgradable and adaptive** â€” capable of evolving alongside modern exploit patterns.  
Ultimately, it may become a **firewall-like layer** for smart accounts, receiving **security patches just like Windows updates**.

## Motivation

I once researched semi-custodial wallet solutions and soon realized that **Gnosis Safe** was a very strong contender.  

Itâ€™s:
- **Cheaper** than traditional multisig setups.  
- **More secure** against internal threats than MPC solutions.  
- Practically **unhackable by pure technology alone** (if implemented correctly).  

However, on **February 21, 2025**, the **Bybit hack** happened â€” and it shattered that assumption.  
The exploit occurred in a way I never imagined possible.  

That incident made me realize something crucial:  
ðŸ‘‰ **Security should be `dynamic`, not static.**

In the current Safe model, once a Guard is deployed, **you need multisig approval to remove or replace it**, which slows down incident response.  
If an exploit happens, redeploying and re-approving a new Guard can take hours â€” time that attackers donâ€™t need.  

With **Diamond Guard**, the Guard itself becomes **modular and upgradeable**.  
You can patch, extend, or modify its logic **on the fly**, without replacing the entire Guard contract or going through a new multisig approval cycle.  

This architecture enables **real-time reaction** to new vulnerabilities, turning the Guard into a **continuously-evolving firewall** for your Safe.
